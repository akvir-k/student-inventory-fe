First and foremost, If you'are using Linux-based-OS, open your terminal and install the latest version of ***NodeJS and npm.***.  
```$ # curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash```
after that install node through nvm.
```$ nvm install node```

after node installation just clone a repository and use git clone for cloning
```git clone https://github.com/virusaman/student-inventory-fe.git```
after cloning github you need to install dependencies which you will use in your project.
```npm install``` with this code all dependencies install autometically.

Now, just type ```npm start``` on your CLI.
